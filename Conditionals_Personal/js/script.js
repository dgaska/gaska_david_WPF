// How many cans of soda can I have
// I have been trying to reduce how much soda I drink
// I am only allowing to myself to have 48oz a day which is a lot less than I normally drink.
// I mainly drink Mountain Dew
// Normally I drink cans(12oz) and the bottles(20oz). I also have the big bottles (24oz) too.
// It is hard with the different sizes it comes in to keep track.

const dailyLimit = 48; // The daily limit allowed

var cans = prompt("How many cans(12oz) did you have today?"); // asking how much drank in 12oz form

var bottles = prompt("How many bottles(20oz) did you drink today?"); // asking how much in 20oz form

var bigBottles = prompt("How many big bottles(24oz) did you have?"); // asking how much in 24oz form

var totalCans = cans * 12;

var totalBottles = bottles * 20;

var totalBigBottles = bigBottles * 24;
